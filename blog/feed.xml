At the time, we had <a href="https://docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus#acknowledgements">8 early adopters</a>.</p> <p>We now have nearly <a href="https://docusaurus.io/en/users">60 known users of Docusaurus</a>, and probably more that we don't know about. We have <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus">9K GitHub stars</a> and an active community, particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/yangshunz">Yangshun Tay</a> ...</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Docusaurus was <a href="https://docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus">officially announced</a> over nine months ago as a way to easily build open source documentation websites. Since then, it has amassed over 8,600 GitHub Stars, and is used by many popular open source projects such as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>, <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">Reason</a> and <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>.</p>
<p>There is a saying that the very best software is constantly evolving, and the very worst is not. In case you are not aware, we have been planning and working on the next version of Docusaurus üéâ.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúJoel and I were discussing having a website and how it would have been great to launch with it. So I challenged myself to add Docusaurus support. It took just over an hour and a half. I'm going to send you a PR with the addition so you can take a look and see if you like it. Your workflow for adding docs wouldn't be much different from editing those markdown files.‚Äù</em></p>
<p><em>‚Äî Note sent to the Profilo team</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the story of the rather short journey it took to create the <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/">Profilo</a> website using Docusaurus.</p>
<p>Profilo, an Android library for collecting performance traces from production, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/356115241551826/profilo-understanding-app-performance-in-the-wild/">was announced</a> earlier this year. The project was <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8">published on GitHub</a> with a less than <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8/docs">a handful or Markdown files</a> to describe its functionality and no website to showcase any branding and highlight the logo. The task at hand was to turn these existing docs and logo into a website.</p>

<p>We are very happy to introduce <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus">Docusaurus</a> to help you manage one or many open source websites.</p>
<p>We created <a href="https://docusaurus.io">Docusaurus</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To put the focus on writing good documentation instead of worrying about the infrastructure of a website.</li>
<li>To provide features that many of our open source websites need like blog support, search and versioning.</li>
<li>To make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone all at once.</li>
<li>And, finally, to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our open source projects.</li>
</ol>
