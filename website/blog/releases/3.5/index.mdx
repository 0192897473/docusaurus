## Highlights

### Blog social icons

In [#10222](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10222), we added the possibility to associate social links to blog authors, for inline authors declared in front matter or global through the `authors.yml` file.

```yml title="blog/authors.yml"
slorber:
  name: SÃ©bastien Lorber
  # other author properties...
  # highlight-start
  socials:
    x: sebastienlorber
    linkedin: sebastienlorber
    github: slorber
    newsletter: https://thisweekinreact.com
  # highlight-end
```

Icons and handle shortcuts are provided for pre-defined platforms `x`, `linkedin`, `github` and `stackoverflow`. It's possible to provide any additional platform entry (like `newsletter` in the example above) with a full URL.

### Blog authors pages

In [#10216](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10216), we added the possibility for [global blog authors](/docs/blog#global-authors) (declared in `authors.yml`) to have their own dedicated page listing all the blog posts they contributed to. This feature is opt-in and mostly relevant for multi-author blogs.

```yml title="blog/authors.yml"
slorber:
  name: SÃ©bastien Lorber
  description: 'A freelance React and React-Native developer...'
  # highlight-next-line
  page: true # Turns the feature on
```

An author index page is also created, listing all the global authors having the feature turned on.
